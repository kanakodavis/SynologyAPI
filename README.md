SynologyAPI
===========

A library to connect to the API of a Synology box. Primarily focused on the AudioStation – for now.

This is supposed to a learning project. To learn C++ and writing clean well documented code - if possible. Since it is a learning project it will probably have a ton of mistakes and illformed code in it. 

If someone has suggestions on how to improve please write an email or make a pull request. The lack of Documentation on the AudioStation API make it kinda hard to work with. I am doing everything with "reverse engineering" via Wireshark and my trusted phone.

Use without any warranty.
